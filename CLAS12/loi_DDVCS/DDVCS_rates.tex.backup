The Acceptance of the proposed experimental setup and expected rates are discussed in this section.
To understand whether we will have good enough acceptance and reasonable rates, we performed Monte Carlo simulations 
of the $ep\rarr e^{\prime}\mu^{-}\mu^{+}p$ reaction. Simulations were limited in the $Q^{2}\in(0.8-7.2)\;GeV^{2}$
and $Q^{\prime 2}\in(1.8-4.8)\;GeV^{2}$ region.

In Fig.\ref{fig:kinematics_general} shown distributions of some kinematic variables: Generated (top left) and reconstructed (top right) 
"$Q^{\prime 2}$ vs $Q^{2}$" distributions, "$Q^{2}$ vs $x_{B}$" is the bottom left, and the bottom right represent $-t$ distribtion 
when $Q^{2}$ and $x_{B}$ are in the following region $Q^{2} \in(2.5 - 3)\;GeV^{2}$ and $x_{B}\in(0.11 - 0.2)$.

In this LOI we will present estimated rates and statistical uncertainties of beam spin asymmetries as a function of
$\Phi_{L}$ by fixing kinematic bin $Q^{2} \in(2. - 3)\;GeV^{2}$, $-t\in (0.1 - 0.4)\; GeV^{2}$, $x_{B}\in(0.11 - 0.2)$, and 
varying $Q^{\prime 2}$ ($Q^{\prime 2} = {2.,\; 2.8,\;  3.6} \;GeV^{2}$).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MC generator description %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Each generated event contains 7 fold cross section which is used for estimation of rates.
\begin{equation}
\frac{\dstl d\sigma}{\dstl dQ^{2} dt dQ^{\prime 2} dx_{B} d\Phi_{L} d\Phi_{cm} d\Theta_{cm}}

Angles $\Phi_{L}$, $\Phi_{CM}$ and $\Theta_{CM}$ are shown on Fig. \ref{fig:DDVCS_Angles}, and their definition is described in the caption
of the figure.
%Calculation of cross section is not fast and it is very unpractical to calculate cross section for each generated event,
%instead the cross section is calculated in a discrete values of $Q^{2}$, $Q^{\prime 2}$, $t$, $\Phi_{L}$, $\Phi_{CM}$ and $\Theta_{CM}$, then
%cross section is extrapolated using the two (in each variable) closest values of already defined cross section.

Kinematic distribtion of detected final state particles are shown in Fig.\ref{fig:particle_kinematic_distr}, where
a, b, and c represent "$\theta$ vs $P$" distributions for $\mu^{-}$, $\mu^{+}$ and $e^{-}$ respectively, and d is the
missing mass of detected $e^{-}\mu^{-}\mu^{+}$ system.
As one can see because of diffferent kinematics of $J/\Psi$ (narrow $M(\mu^{-}\mu^{+})$ mass region) and DDCS (wide $M(\mu^{-}\mu^{+})$,
kinematic distributions "$\theta$ vs $P$" are not quite similar,
however missing mass resolution is still as good as in $J/\Psi$
case (see Figs. \ref{fig:jp_mukine} and \ref{fig:jp_mres}), and will allow ensure exclusivity of the reaction.

For the abovementioned kinematic bin, the acceptance and expected rates in different bins of $Q^{\prime 2}$ are shown in \ref{fig:Acc_and_rates_Qp2}

 are shown in \ref{fig:counts_and_errorbars0}, \ref{fig:counts_and_errorbar1} and \ref{fig:counts_and_errorbars2}

The main goal  for J/$\Psi$ electroproductionis to study t-dependence of the cross section for different Q$^2$ ranges. In order to calculate acceptances, cross sections, and the rates, coverage in kinematics is studied for events when electron, $\mu^+$ and $\mu^-$ are detected, and electron has momentum $p>0.5$ GeV/c. In Fig.\ref{fig:jp_e0p5_q2w} Q$^2$ vs W (total invariant mass) is shown. Because of rather limited energy range, we will integrate the full W-rage for a given Q$^2$ bin. So the future selection proceeds for W-range $4.025 < W < 4.525$ GeV.

Fig.\ref{fig:jp_q2t} shows Q$^2$ - t landscape in the selected W-range. Based on this distribution the t-dependance was studied for three bins of Q$^2$, $0.1<$Q$^2 <0.3$ GeV$^2$, $0.3<$Q$^2 <1.$ GeV$^2$, and $1<$Q$^2 < 2.5$ GeV$^2$. The average values of Q$^2$ in each bin are $0.19$ GeV$^2$,  $0.5$ GeV$^2$, and $1.45$ GeV$^2$, respectively. For these studies cross sections are calculated using bin average values for W, Q$^2$, and $t$.


\subsubsection{Cross Section Formalism.}
\indent

The cross section of $t$-channel meson electroproduction on the
nucleon (see diagram on Figure \ref{fig:diagn}), integrated over the
azimuthal angle between electron and hadron planes, can be presented 
as a sum of cross sections for transversely ($\sigma_T$), and
longitudinally ($\sigma_L$) polarized photons: 
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:cse}
{d\sigma _{eN \rightarrow eM^0 N}  \over dQ^2dWdt}=
\Gamma_W\cdot ({d\sigma_T \over dt}~+~\epsilon{d\sigma_L \over dt}) \ .
\end{eqnarray}
Here $\Gamma_W$ is the flux of virtual photons and is defined as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:flux}
\Gamma_W=
{\alpha\over 4\pi}\cdot{W^2-m^2\over m^2E^2}\cdot{W\over Q^2}\cdot 
{1\over 1-\epsilon}  \ .
\end{eqnarray}
In the equations above, $\epsilon$ is the virtual photon polarization and is
given by:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:eps}
\epsilon = \left( 1+2{Q^2+q^{02}\over 4EE'-Q^2} \right)^{-1} \ .
\end{eqnarray}

\caption{Diagram for electroproduction of a $t$-channel meson on the nucleon.}
\label{fig:diagn}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The other kinematical variables are: electron transfered momentum squared
$Q^2=-q^{\mu 2}$ were $q^\mu=(k^\mu-k^{\prime \mu})$ is the four-momentum 
of the virtual photon, and $k^\mu$($k^{\prime\mu}$) is the 
four-momentum of incoming (outgoing) electron. In Eq.(\ref{eq:cse}) $t$
is the transferred momentum squared to the target, and the mass squared 
of the virtual photon hadron system, $W^2$, is:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:w}
W^2~=~m^2+2mq^0 - Q^2 \ ,
\end{eqnarray}
$m$ is the nucleon mass.

Using vector meson dominance (VDM) one can relate $\sigma_T$
and $\sigma_L$ to the photoproduction cross section \cite{vdm}.
The relation for $\sigma_T$ is:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:st}
\sigma_T ~=~  \left( {m_{J/\Psi}^2\over 
m_{J/\Psi}^2+Q^2} \right) ^2\cdot \sigma_{\gamma N \rightarrow M^0N} \ ,
\end{eqnarray}
and for $\sigma_L$:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq:sl}
\sigma_L~=~\left( {m_{J/\Psi}^2\over m_{J/\Psi}^2+Q^2} 
\right) ^2\cdot 
{Q^2\over m_{J/\Psi}^2}\cdot (1-x)^2
\cdot \xi(Q^2,\nu)\cdot \sigma_{\gamma N \rightarrow M^0p} \ ,
\end{eqnarray}
where $m_{J/\Psi}$ is the $J/\Psi$ meson mass. 
$\xi(Q^2,\nu)$ scales the model to the data, and is taken to be $0.5$ for our calculations.  
The $x=Q^2/(2qp)$ where $p$ is the four-momentum of the target nucleon. 
The $\sigma_{\gamma N
\rightarrow M^0N^\prime}$ is the photoproduction cross section. For our calculations we used 2-gluon formalism for the differential cross section from \cite{brodsky:2000zc}:

\begin{eqnarray}
{d\sigma\over {dt}} = N_{2g}\nu{(1-x)^2\over{R^2M^2}}F^2_{2g}(t)(s-m_p^2)^2
\end{eqnarray}
where where $F_{2g}(t)$ is the proton form factors that take into account the fact that the three target quarks recombine into the final proton after the emission of two gluons. The $N_{2g}$ is scaling factor to saturate measured cross sections, $M$ is the mass of the $c\bar c$, $R$ is the proton radius (taken as $1$ fm, $s$ is the center mass energy square and the $x$ is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by the valence quark.

This cross section model has been used to calculate cross sections for the experiment E-12-12-001 \cite{e1212001}. The $t$-distribution for exclusive $J/\Psi$ photoproduction from E12-12-001 proposal is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:jpsixs2}. The same code was used to calculate cross sections for the electroproduction cross section in the kinematics of the present proposal.

\subsubsection{Rates and projected results}
\indent

 Using photoproduction cross sections, $d\sigma/dt$,  from calculations presented in the proposal for the experiment E12-12-001 \cite{e1212001}, first $\sigma_T$ and $\sigma_L$ are calculated as described in Eqs. \ref{eq:st} and \ref{eq:sl}, then the virtual photon flux, $\Gamma_W$ (Eq.\ref{eq:flux}), and the cross section d$\sigma$/dW/dQ$^2$/dt as presented in Eq.\ref{eq:cse} using the bin average kinematical points (W, Q$^2$, and $t$). In Fig.\ref{fig:jp_rates} expected rates as a function of $t$ are shown for three Q$^2$ bins. The projected t-dependances of measured cross section is shown in Fig.\ref{fig:jp_xs}. The error bars on the points are expected statistical accuracy as shown in Fig.\ref{fig:jp_rates}.
